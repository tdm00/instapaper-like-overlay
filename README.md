# Instapaper-like Screen Overlay

## What is this?

I really like the way the new Instapaper bookmarklet applies a black full screen overlay of the current web page and shows white text indicating that it's being saved.  I wanted something similiar to this for an application that I'm developing.  This was the working example that I was able to come up with.
